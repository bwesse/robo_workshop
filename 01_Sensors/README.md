### Introduction to Sensors in Robotics

Sensors are **critical components** in robotics, enabling robots to **perceive and interact** with their environment. They provide data that can be used for **navigation**, **object detection**, **orientation**, and more. In this section, we will give a general overview of sensors and introduce the specific sensors we will be using in our project.

### What Are Sensors?

Sensors are devices that detect and measure **physical properties** such as temperature, light, distance, acceleration, and more. They convert these physical properties into **electrical signals** that can be read and processed by a **microcontroller** or computer. Sensors are essential for:

- **Environmental Interaction**: Allowing robots to detect and respond to their surroundings.
- **Navigation**: Helping robots understand their position and movement.
- **Automation**: Enabling autonomous decision-making based on sensor inputs.

### Types of Sensors in Robotics

There are many types of sensors used in robotics, each serving a specific purpose. Some common types include:

- **Proximity Sensors**: Detect the presence of nearby objects without physical contact.
- **Distance Sensors**: Measure the distance to an object. Examples include ultrasonic sensors and infrared sensors.
- **Light Sensors**: Measure the intensity of light. Examples include photoresistors and photodiodes.
- **Temperature Sensors**: Measure temperature. Examples include thermistors and thermocouples.
- **Accelerometers and Gyroscopes**: Measure acceleration and rotational movement, respectively. These are often combined in inertial measurement units (IMUs).
- **Pressure Sensors**: Measure pressure in gases or liquids.

### Sensors in Our Project

In our robotics project, we will be using the following sensors:

- **MPU6050 (Accelerometer and Gyroscope)**
    - The MPU6050 is an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** that combines a **3-axis accelerometer** and a **3-axis gyroscope**. It provides data on the robot's **orientation**, **acceleration**, and **rotational speed**.
    - **Applications**: Balancing robots, motion tracking, and orientation sensing.
- **Distance Sensor**
    - Distance sensors measure the distance between the sensor and an object. Common types include **ultrasonic sensors** and **infrared sensors**. We will use one to **detect obstacles** and navigate around them.
    - **Applications**: Obstacle avoidance, object detection, and distance measurement.

### Importance of Sensors in Robotics

Sensors play a **vital role** in robotics by providing the data needed for:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Allowing robots to move and navigate without human intervention.
- **Environmental Awareness**: Enabling robots to detect and respond to changes in their surroundings.
- **Safety**: Helping robots avoid collisions and operate safely in dynamic environments.
- **Precision Control**: Allowing precise movements and adjustments based on real-time feedback.

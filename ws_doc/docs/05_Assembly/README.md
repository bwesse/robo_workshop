### Step 2: Wiring the Components on the Breadboard

1. **Place the Arduino Nano on the Breadboard**:
   - Ensure it is placed in a central location for easy access to all pins.

2. **Connect the Motors to the L298N Motor Driver**:
   - **Motor 1**:
     - Connect one motor terminal to **OUT1** on the L298N.
     - Connect the other motor terminal to **OUT2** on the L298N.
   - **Motor 2**:
     - Connect one motor terminal to **OUT3** on the L298N.
     - Connect the other motor terminal to **OUT4** on the L298N.

3. **Power the L298N Motor Driver**:
   - Connect the positive terminal of the battery to the **12V** input on the L298N.
   - Connect the negative terminal of the battery to the **GND** input on the L298N.
   - Ensure a separate wire connects the **5V** output of the L298N to the **5V** rail on the breadboard.
   - Connect the **GND** on the L298N to the **GND** rail on the breadboard.

4. **Connect the nRF24L01 Module to the Arduino Nano**:

   - **SDA** to **A4** on Arduino Nano

6. **Connect the LED Strip (WS2812B) to the Arduino Nano**:
   - **DIN** to **D2** on Arduino Nano
   - **VCC** to **5V** on the breadboard
   - **GND** to **GND** on the breadboard

7. **Connect the L298N Control Pins to the Arduino Nano**:
   - **ENA** to **D3** on Arduino Nano
   - **IN1** to **D4** on Arduino Nano
   - **IN2** to **D5** on Arduino Nano
   - **IN3** to **D6** on Arduino Nano
   - **IN4** to **D7** on Arduino Nano
   - **ENB** to **D8** on Arduino Nano

### Step 3: Powering Up

1. **Connect the Battery**:
   - Ensure all connections are secure.
   - Connect the battery to power up the system.
   - If using a 9V battery, ensure it can provide sufficient current for the motors and electronics. You might need a battery pack with multiple batteries for higher current requirements.

### Step 4: Final Check

1. **Inspect Wiring**:
   - Double-check all connections to ensure they are correct and secure.
   - Ensure there are no short circuits.

2. **Test the Setup**:
   - Power on the Arduino Nano and check if all components (motors, LED strip, ToF sensor) are receiving power.
   - Use the nRF24L01 module for communication tests if applicable.

## Tips

- Use zip ties or cable organizers to keep the wiring neat and secure.
- Ensure the power supply can handle the current requirements of the motors and electronics.
- If using a breadboard, ensure all connections are firm to avoid intermittent issues.

## Troubleshooting

- **No Power**: Check the battery connections and ensure the power switch (if any) is turned on.
- **Motors Not Responding**: Verify the PWM signals from the Arduino Nano and check the connections to the L298N motor driver.
- **Intermittent Connections**: Ensure all jumper wires are firmly connected and not loose.

This guide should help you assemble your robot with the components discussed. Once assembled, you can proceed with programming the Arduino Nano to control the robot using the nRF24L01 module and the FlySky remote. Happy building!

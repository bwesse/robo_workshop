## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the various types of sensors used in robotics, their functions, and applications.

## Types of Sensors

<details>
  <summary>Proximity Sensors</summary>
  
  Proximity sensors detect objects nearby without any physical contact. They are used in various applications such as:

  - **Touchless switches**
  - **Safety systems**
  - **Robotic arms**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Infrared Sensors</summary>
  
  Infrared sensors measure distance and detect obstacles using infrared light. Applications include:

  - **Remote controls**
  - **Obstacle detection in robots**
  - **Thermal imaging**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Ultrasonic Sensors</summary>
  
  Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves to measure distance. They are commonly used for:

  - **Obstacle avoidance in robots**
  - **Level measurement**
  - **Proximity detection**

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Gyroscope</summary>
  
  Gyroscopes measure orientation and angular velocity. Applications include:

  - **Navigation systems**
  - **Stabilization in drones**
  - **Motion sensing**

</details>

## Practical Exercises

<details>
  <summary>Exercise 1: Connect and Calibrate an Ultrasonic Sensor</summary>
  
  Follow these steps to connect and calibrate your ultrasonic sensor:

  1. Connect the sensor to the microcontroller.
  2. Upload the calibration code.
  3. Test the sensor readings.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Exercise 2: Program a Robot to Avoid Obstacles</summary>
  
  Using infrared sensors, program your robot to avoid obstacles:

  1. Attach the infrared sensors to your robot.
  2. Write the obstacle avoidance code.
  3. Test and refine your code.

</details>

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned about different types of sensors and how to use them in your robotics projects.

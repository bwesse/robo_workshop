### Using a Standard FlySky Remote and Receiver with Arduino

In this section, we'll learn how to integrate a standard FlySky remote control and its corresponding receiver with an Arduino. This setup allows you to remotely control your robot with a professional-grade RC transmitter.

### Understanding the FlySky Remote System

FlySky remotes are popular in the RC (radio control) hobby community due to their reliability and ease of use. They typically come with a transmitter (the remote control) and a receiver, which communicates wirelessly with the transmitter to relay commands to your project.

### Components Needed

- FlySky FS-i6 Transmitter
- FlySky FS-iA6B Receiver
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- Power supply (appropriate for the receiver, typically 5V from the Arduino)

### Wiring the FlySky Receiver to the Arduino

The FlySky FS-iA6B receiver outputs PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals for each channel. Each channel corresponds to a control on the transmitter, such as a joystick or switch.

**Connections:**

1. **Power the Receiver:**
    - **VCC** (5V) on the receiver to **5V** on the Arduino
    - **GND** on the receiver to **GND** on the Arduino
2. **Connect PWM Channels to Arduino:**
    - **Channel 1** (CH1) on the receiver to a digital input pin (e.g., **D2** on the Arduino)
    - **Channel 2** (CH2) on the receiver to a digital input pin (e.g., **D3** on the Arduino)
    - Repeat for additional channels as needed

### Reading PWM Signals from the Receiver

The receiver outputs PWM signals, which the Arduino can read and interpret. Each PWM signal consists of a series of pulses where the pulse width represents the position of the control on the transmitter.

### Example Code for Reading PWM Signals

We'll use the `pulseIn` function to measure the duration of the high pulse from the receiver, which corresponds to the position of the joystick or other control.

```arduino
const int ch1Pin = 2; // Pin connected to CH1
const int ch2Pin = 3; // Pin connected to CH2

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(ch1Pin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ch2Pin, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Read the pulse width from CH1
  unsigned long ch1PulseWidth = pulseIn(ch1Pin, HIGH);
  // Read the pulse width from CH2
  unsigned long ch2PulseWidth = pulseIn(ch2Pin, HIGH);

  // Print the pulse widths to the Serial Monitor
  Serial.print("CH1: ");
  Serial.print(ch1PulseWidth);
  Serial.print(" CH2: ");
  Serial.println(ch2PulseWidth);

  delay(100);
}

```

### Interpreting the PWM Signals

The `pulseIn` function measures the duration of the high pulse in microseconds. The pulse width typically ranges from 1000 to 2000 microseconds:

- **1000 microseconds**: Control is at one extreme (e.g., joystick fully left or down)
- **1500 microseconds**: Control is centered
- **2000 microseconds**: Control is at the other extreme (e.g., joystick fully right or up)

### Controlling a Robot with PWM Signals

Once you have the pulse widths, you can map these values to control various aspects of your robot, such as motor speed, direction, or servo position.

**Example: Controlling a Motor**

Let's assume you want to control the speed of a motor using the joystick on your FlySky transmitter.

```arduino
const int motorPin = 9; // Pin connected to the motor driver

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(ch1Pin, INPUT);
  pinMode(motorPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  unsigned long ch1PulseWidth = pulseIn(ch1Pin, HIGH);

  // Map the pulse width to a PWM value (0-255) for motor speed
  int motorSpeed = map(ch1PulseWidth, 1000, 2000, 0, 255);

  // Set the motor speed
  analogWrite(motorPin, motorSpeed);

  Serial.print("Motor Speed: ");
  Serial.println(motorSpeed);

  delay(100);
}

```

### Tasks

### Task 1: Reading Additional Channels (Easy)

**Context:**
Extend the example to read additional channels from the receiver, such as CH3 and CH4. Display these values on the Serial Monitor.

- **Hint to Get Started:**
    - Connect additional channels (CH3, CH4) to digital pins on the Arduino.
    - Use the `pulseIn` function to read the pulse widths from these channels.
    - Display the pulse widths for all channels on the Serial Monitor.

### Task 2: Control Multiple LEDs (Medium)

**Context:**
Use the FlySky remote to control multiple LEDs connected to the receiver Arduino. For example, use one channel to control the brightness of an LED and another channel to switch between different LEDs.

- **Hint to Get Started:**
    - Connect multiple LEDs to different digital pins on the Arduino.
    - Map the PWM values from the remote to control LED brightness using `analogWrite`.
    - Implement logic to switch between different LEDs based on the received PWM values.

### Task 3: Control a Servo Motor (Hard)

**Context:**
Use the FlySky remote to control the position of a servo motor. This requires interpreting the PWM signal and mapping it to the servo’s range of motion.

- **Hint to Get Started:**
    - Connect the servo motor to a PWM-capable pin on the Arduino.
    - Use the `Servo` library to control the servo.
    - Map the received PWM values to the servo’s angle range (0 to 180 degrees) and adjust the servo position accordingly.

### Conclusion

Integrating a FlySky remote and receiver with your Arduino allows for precise and responsive control over your robotic projects. By completing these tasks, you'll gain a deeper understanding of using PWM signals to control various components, enhancing the functionality and interactivity of your robot.
